# Tic-tac-toe game

Tic-tac-toe game - two players draw tic-tac-toe (figures) on a field of 9 squares until they get a line of 3 identical figures or until all the squares are filled.
A single player game with a computer that responds randomly to the player.
To implement graphics, I used the PyGame library.
